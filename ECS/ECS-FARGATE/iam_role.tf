# Difference between AWS Elastic Container Service's (ECS) ExecutionRole and TaskRole
# the execution role is the IAM role that executes ECS actions such as pulling the image and storing
# the application logs in cloudwatch. TaskRole then, is the IAM role used by the task itself. 
# For example, if your container wants to call other AWS services like S3, SQS, etc
